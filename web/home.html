                This is a dumb little website I made for plutocraft. I really made it for the enjoyment/learning process. I haven't actually made a proper website before
                and kinda avoided webdev like the plague... Enjoy :)

                Just make sure not to steal, cheat, grief, DDoS, hack that kind of thing.

                Also a catch all rule, treat everyone with respect and use common sense.
